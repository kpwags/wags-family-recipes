## Ingredients

### For the Cake and Mousse

- 18.25 oz. box devil’s food cake mix (plus required ingredients)
- 14 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 12 tbsp. unsalted butter, diced
- ¼ cup strong coffee
- 10 eggs, separated
- 1 ½ cups, plus 6 tbsp. sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 cups cold heavy cream

### For the Shell and Sauce

- 12 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 5 tbsp. light corn syrup
- 2 tbsp. unsalted butter

## Directions

1. Make the cake: Prepare the cake per directions for a 9x13 cake. Cool slightly in the pan then invert onto a rack to cool completely
2. Clean out the cake pan and line it with plastic wrap
3. Cut the cake in half lengthwise, then in thirds crosswise to make 6 rectangles
4. Using a serrated knife, slice each rectangle in half to make two layers
5. Arrange half of the pieces snugly in the cake pan.
6. Crumble the remaining pieces and press tightly into 6 small balls; arrange 1 cake ball in the center of each rectangle in the pan
7. Make the mousse: Heat the chocolate, butter, coffee, and ¼ cup water in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch the water) stirring until melted; Remove the bowl from the pan; stir until cool. Reserve the simmering water.
8. Fill a large bowl with ice water
9. Whisk the egg yolks, 1 ½ cups sugar and 2 tbsp. water in a separate large heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch the water) and whisk until a pale yellow, 6-8 minutes
10. Add the chocolate-coffee mixture and the vanilla and whisk until combined, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and set in the bowl of ice water; whisk until cool, but not thick, about 4 minutes
11. Beat the egg whites and salt in a bowl with a mixer until foamy. Add 2 tbsp. sugar and beat until almost stiff.
12. Gently fold into the chocolate-yolk mixture to make a dark chocolate mousse.
13. Spread 5 cups over the cake and cake balls. Freeze until firm on top, about 30 minutes.
14. Beat the heavy cream and the remaining 4 tbsp. sugar until soft peaks form; fold with the remaining mousse. Remove the cake from the freezer and spread with the light chocolate mousse.
15. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight
16. Make the chocolate shell: Stir the chocolate, heavy cream, and 4 tbsp. corn syrup in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until melted.
17. A spoonful at a time, spread half of the shell mixture over the frozen mousse. Return to the freezer
18. Make the chocolate sauce: Add the remaining 1 tbsp. corn syrup and the butter to the remaining chocolate shell mixture. Microwave for 30 seconds, then stir until glossy
19. Top each piece of cake with ice cream and whipped cream
